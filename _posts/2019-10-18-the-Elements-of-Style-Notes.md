以前考研，在准备英语作文时，看到了这本论述英语写作的短小精悍的书籍，读之，此为笔记。

1. 单个连词连接起来的三个或三个以上的短语，除了最后一个短语，在其他每个短语的后面使用逗号：
    
    >red, white, and blue
	
    >He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

2. 把插入语放在逗号之间。如果插入语前面有连词，则把逗号置于连词之前：
    
    >The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.
	
    >My brother, you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health, and is indefensible.

    下面的几种情况均视为是插入的，要求放在逗号之间：
	
    - 年月日以及星期表示时间时
	
        >February to July, 1916
		
        >Monday, November 11, 1918
	
    - 缩写的etc.和jr.
	
    - 非限制性子句以及用连词引导的用于指示时间和地点的子句。非限制性子句与定语从句不同，非限制性子句不对先行词进行识别和定义，而是作补充说明，通常可以从主句中取出来成为两个独立的句子，它不影响整个句子的语义和语法完整。
        
		>非限制性子句<br>
		Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their dominions to the east, and rose to royal rank with the possession of Sicily, exchanged afterwards for Sardinia.
        
		>非限制性子句<br>
		The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.
		
		>定语从句<br>
        The candidate who best meets these requirements, will obtain the place.
		
		>用于指示时间和地点的子句<br>
        Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is a few miles from Bridgewater.
        
		>定语从句<br>
		The day will come when you will admit your mistake.

3. 引导同等子句的连词前使用逗号。这是推荐的正式用法，在非正式场合也存在省略逗号的情况：
    
    - 引导同等子句的连词前使用逗号，如果这子句间存在更强的关系，比如因果或假设关系，应当改写成更恰当的表达。
	    
        >The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.
        
		修改成：
        
		>Although the situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.
		
        >In this perilous situation, there is still one chance of escape.
		
    - 如果第二个子句是以as(作“因为”时)、for、or、nor和while（作“当…，同时”时）等连词引导的，在这些连词前加逗号。
	    
        >The mother closed the door quietly, as she was afraid to wake the baby.
		
	    >She did not dare affront him, for she understand the pride of artists.
    	
		>She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the other side of the globe, while she was here in the cold.
	
    - 当两个子句共有同一个主语，且主语只使用过一次时，如果连接两个子句的连词是but,要使用逗号；如果连接两个子句的连词是and，则省略逗号。
        
		>I have heard his arguments, but am still unconvinced.
    	
		>He has had several years’ experience and is thoroughly competent.
	
    - 如果连接子句的是副词，比如accordingly、besides、then、thus和therefore，或者不是连词连接的，要使用分号，而不是逗号。
	    
        >He ever lies; therefore, everyone likes to make friends with him.

4. 使用分号连接意义独立的子句：
    
    - 如果两个或多个子句共同构成一个复合句子，而且这些子句在语法上是完整的且不被连词连接，那么应该使用分号。
          
        >It is nearly half past five; we can’t reach town before dark.
	    
        此时也可以把分号改成句号：
		
        >It is nearly half past five. We can’t reach town before dark.
		
        如果使用了连词，则应改成逗号：
		
        >It is nearly half past five, and we can’t reach town before dark.
		
        比较上述三种用法，使用分号是最恰当的。相比句号，分号更能暗示各个子句的关系；相比连词，则更加简洁，因而更具说服力。
		
    - 有两种例外情况可以使用逗号，一种是这些子句很短而且在格式上相似；另一种情况是在非正式的通俗表达中。
        
		>Man proposes, God disposes.
        
		>I hardly knew him, he was so changed.
	
5. 位于句首的插入语必须指向语法上的主语：
    
	>Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.
    
	这里的walking指的是句子的主语he，而不是woman，如果要让其指向woman，则应该修改为：
    
	>He saw a woman accompanied by two children, walking slowly down the road.
    
	插入短语可以是不定式、过去分词、现在分词、连词或介词短语、同位名词、形容词、形容短语等等。
    
	>Seen from the top, the farmhouse looked deserted.
    
	>On his arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station.
    
	>A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the city.
    
	>Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy.

6. 省略无用的词语。
    
	有力的写作是简明的。一句话应该不包括多余的词语，一个段落应当不包括多余的句子，正如画作无需多余的线条，机器无需多余的组件。
	
    - 许多常见的表达都违背了该原则。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
        |the question as to whether|whether|
        |there is no doubt but that|no doubt|
        |used for fuel purposes|used for fuel|
		|he is a man who|he|
		|in a hasty manner|hastily|
		|this is a subject which|this subject|
		|His story is a strange one.|His story is strange.|
	
    - 一些常见的词语或者短语的表达，比如case、character、nature、system、the fact that、who is、which is、the like等等，几乎总是可以改写成更简洁的表达。
	
	    |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|owing to/ in spite of the fact that|since/though|
		|I was unaware of the fact that|I was unaware that|
		|In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated.|Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated.|
		|Dayton has adopted the commission system of government.|Dayton has adopted government by commission.|
		|His brother, who is a member of the same firm|His brother, a member of the same firm|
		|Trafalgar, which was Nelson’s last battle|Trafalgar, Nelson’s last battle|

7. 避免连续的松散句子。
    
	- 这条规则尤指适用这种类型的松散情况：即这些句子由多个等同的子句组成，而后面的子句一般由连词引出。尽管单个此类型的句子是可行的，但是一连串的这种句子则变得单调和冗长。这种情况下，作者通常大量使用诸如and、but、so等连词，其次则是使用who、which、when、where和while等词，最后才使用非限制性子句。
	    
		>The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music. The former showed himself to be an artist of the first rank, while the latter proved itself fully deserving of its high reputation. The interest aroused by the series has been very gratifying to the Committee, and it is planned to give a similar series annually hereafter. The fourth concert will be given on Tuesday, May 10, when an equally attractive program will be presented.
    
	    上面的句子除了显得陈腐和空洞，由于句子结构的机械对称和缺乏抑扬顿挫，也变得无力。
		
        当句子由于出现这种情况时，应当去掉千篇一律的句子，代之以简单的句子，或使分号连接子句的句子，或非限定子句。
	
        >While the present century was in its teens, and on one sunshiny morning in June, there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton’s academy for young ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large family coach, with two fat horses in blazing harness, driven by a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat and wig, at the rate of four miles an hour. A black servant, who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton’s shining brass plate, and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house. - William Makepeace Thackeray, Vanity Fair.
	
	- 一个常见违背简洁的情况是在表达单个复杂观点时，使用一步步的、一系列零散的且相互独立的句子，而不是试图把这些句子组合成紧凑的单个句子。
	
	    |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
        |Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king.|Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place.|
        |There were several less important courses, but there were the most important, and although they did not come every day, they came often enough to keep you in such a state of mind that you never knew what your next move would be.|These, the most important courses of all, came, if not daily, at least often enough to keep one under constant strain.|

8. 用相似的格式表达同等的观点。
    
    - 在并行的思路中，使用相似的表达结构，这使得读者更容易理解文章在内容和功能上的相似之处。这种行文方式在圣经、十诫、祷文中十分普遍。尽管在强调一个重复的表述时的确需要变换结构以避免单调，但这条规则在有限的行文范围内是可行的。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed.|Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method.|
	
	- 按照此原则，施加在一系列同等成员上的文字或介词要么只在第一个成员上使用一次，要么在每个成员上都重复一次。这同样适用于其他表示相关的表达，比如both、and、not、but、not only, but also、either、or、first, second, third等等。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese|The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese|
		|In spring, summer, or in winter|In spring, summer, or winter|
		|A time not for words, but action.|A time not for words, but for action.|
		|My objections are, first, the injustice of the measure; second, that it is unconstitutional.|My objections are, first, that the measure is unjust; second, that it is unconstitutional.|
	
9. 将相关联的词语放在一起。
	
	- 句子中词语的远近表示了它们的关系，因此，尽可能将相关联的词语更近。句子的主语和其主要的动词不应该被词组或子句给隔开，这时，可以降这些词组或子句放在句首。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church.|In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church.|
		|Cast iron, when treated in a Bessemer converter, is changed into steel.|By treatment in a Bessemer converter, cast iron is changed into steel.|
	
	    通常，当句子的顺序只是被一个相关的子句，或者同位语所打断，或是在某些情况下作者故意地通过周期性句子来打断语序以创造悬念，并不适用该规则。
	
	- 相关的代词应当立即出现在其先行词的后面。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|There was a book in his eye that boded mischief.|In his eye was a book that boded mischief.|
		|He wrote three articles about his adventures in Spain, which were published in Harper’s Magazine.|He published in Harper’s Magazine three articles about his adventures in Spain.|
		|This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry Harrison, who became President in 1889.|This is a portrait of Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry Harrison. He became President in 1889.|
		
		如果先行词不止一个，除非会引起歧义，相关代词应出现在这组先行词的最后。
		
		|A proposal to amend the Sherman Act, which has been variously judged.|A proposal, which has been variously judged, to amend the Sherman Act.|
        ||A proposal to amend the much-debated Sherman Act.|
		|The grandson of William Henry Harrison, who|William Henry Harrison’s grandson, who|
	
	- 修饰词应当靠近被其修饰的词，如果多个修饰词修饰同一个词，应当合理安排以避免出现错误的关系。
	
        |-|-|
        |:-|:-|
		|All the members were not present.|Not all the members were present.|
		|Major R.E.Joyce will give a lecture on Tuesday evening in Bailey Hall, to which the public is invited, on “My Experiences in Mesopotamia” at eight P.M.|On Tuesday evening at eight P.M, Major R.E.Joyce will give a lecture on “My Experiences in Mesopotamia”. The public is invited.|

10. 在总结时，保持同一个时态。
    
	- 在总结剧本的情节时应一直使用现在时。在总结诗歌、故事或小说时，更适合使用现在时，尽管也可以用过去式。如果总结是现在时，那么先前的动作则是现在完成时；如果是过去式，则是过去完成时。
	
	- 不管在总结中使用什么时态，在间接的对话和问题中的过去式应当保持不变。
	
        >The Friar confesses that it was who married them.
    
	- 一旦选定了某种时态进行表述，就要一直保持。

11. 将强调语气的词语放在一个句子的末尾。

    一个句子的末尾通常是最显眼的，将要强调的词置于句尾。除了主语，对于很多词语，句首也是一个很显眼的位置。
    
	|-|-|
	|:-|:-|
	|Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways.|Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude.|
	|The steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness.|Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors.|
